        <h3>Delicious and Patriotic Cheese Burger</h3>

        <p>The best-tasting burger is always made using the finest, leanest beef, like this recipe. This really has to be tried - burgers are rarely made like this any more. Try serving with tomato salsa.</p>

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 slice brown bread</li>
            <li>1kg lean minced Angus beef</li>
            <li>1 garlic clove, crushed</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh thyme</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Dijon mustard</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>Dash of Tabasco sauce</li>
            <li>Splash of vegetable (rapeseed) oil</li>
            <li>Toasted sesame-seed burger buns, to serve</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Steps</h4>

        <ol>
            <li>Whizz the brown bread in a blender to make crumbs.</li>
            <li>Place all the remaining ingredients (except for the oil and the buns) in a large mixing bowl and, adding the breadcrumbs, mix with your hands so it all comes together. Make into patties.</li>
            <li>Heat a little oil in a pan and cook the patties for 2â€“3 minutes on each side; keep on the medium-rare side.</li>
            <li>Serve on toasted sesame-seed buns.</li>
        </ol>
