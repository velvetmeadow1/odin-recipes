    <h3>Healthy Tuna Noodle Cassarole</h3>




    <p>This classic casserole dish starts with a creamy mushroom sauce combined with delicate egg noodles, peas, and tuna, then topped with a buttery breadcrumb, cracker, or potato chip topping. The classic version of tuna noodle casserole uses a can of condensed cream of mushroom soup for the sauce, but in the recipe below I’ve whipped up a homemade creamy mushroom sauce instead. It does take a little more time, but it’s totally worth it, IMHO!

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 yellow onion, diced</li>
            <li>4 tbsp butter, divided</li>
            <li>8oz. mushrooms, sliced</li>
            <li>3/4 tsp salt, divided</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp pepper</li>
            <li>2 tbsp all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 cups whole milk</li>
            <li>1 cup vegetable or chicken broth</li>
            <li>4 oz. cream cheese</li>
            <li>1/2 cup frozen peas</li>
            <li>8 oz. wide egg noodles</li>
            <li>2 tbsp breadcrumbs</li>
            <li>tbsp grated parmesan</li>
            <li>12 oz. chunk light tuna, drained</li>
        </ul> <!--what a pain typing those also i relaized halfway through i spelled casserole wrong...LOL :D -->

    <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Finely dice the onion and add it to a skillet with 1 Tbsp butter. Sauté the onion over medium heat until softened.</li>
            <li>While the onion is cooking, slice the mushrooms. Add them to the skillet with the onion and ¼ tsp each of salt and pepper. Continue sautéing over medium heat until the mushrooms have softened. Remove the mushrooms and onions from the skillet and set aside.</li>
            <li>Add the flour and an additional 2 Tbsp butter to the skillet. Cook and whisk over medium heat as the butter melts. Continue whisking as the butter and flour bubbles and foams for about one minute.</li>
            <li>Add the milk, broth, and cream cheese to the skillet. Whisk to combine with the butter and flour mixture. Continue cooking over medium, whisking until the cream cheese has fully melted in and the sauce begins to simmer, at which point it will thicken.</li>
            <li>Add the frozen peas and the cooked mushrooms and onions back to the sauce. Stir to combine, then season with more salt and pepper (about ½ tsp salt and another pinch of pepper). Set the sauce aside.</li>
            <li>Begin to preheat the oven to 350ºF. Bring a large pot of water to a boil for the noodles. Once boiling, add the egg noodles and boil for about 7 minutes, or just until tender. Drain the noodles in a colander.</li>
            <li>While the noodles are boiling, prepare the breadcrumb topping. Melt 1 Tbsp butter, then stir in the breadcrumbs and Parmesan.</li>
            <li>Combine the creamy mushroom sauce, cooked and drained noodles, and drained tuna.</li>
            <li>Transfer the casserole mixture to a 3 quart casserole dish, then top with the breadcrumb topping.</li>
            <li>Bake the casserole for about 25 minutes or until heated through and golden brown on top. Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
